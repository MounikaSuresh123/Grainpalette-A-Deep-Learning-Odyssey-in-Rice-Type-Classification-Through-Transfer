# Grainpalette-A-Deep-Learning-Odyssey-in-Rice-Type-Classification-Through-Transfer
**GrainPalette** is a deep learning-based project that classifies rice types using transfer learning. It uses pre-trained CNN models like MobileNetV2 to identify rice varieties such as Basmati or Jasmine from images, improving accuracy, speed, and efficiency in rice quality control and agricultural automation.
